###### **Project Overview: Pixel Sorting in Art and Animation**
#### Part 1: Incorporating Pixel Sorting into Our Design
- In our project, I plan to integrate Pixel Sorting, a technique popularized by Kim Asendorf, into the design. This method involves rearranging the pixels in an image, which introduces abstract elements and disrupts the image’s conventional structure to create a unique visual effect.

By applying pixel sorting to our selected artwork, “Wheels of Fortune”, we can amplify the dynamic interaction between chaos and order. The pixel distortion will enhance the animation by visually representing the underlying tension in the artwork, making it more engaging. Considering the project’s requirements, this technique effectively conveys complex emotions and contrasts, adding layers of depth to the final visual output.

Here’s an example of pixel sorting applied to abstract art from Kim Asendorf: ![An image of pixel art ](https://ejz2x5ppb98.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/artifact-4-copia-1536x864.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1)

#### Part 2: Kim Asendorf’s Pixel Sorting Technique
- Kim Asendorf's Pixel Sorting technique, as showcased in his GitHub repository, is an efficient method for generating glitch-style artwork. By sorting image pixels based on properties such as brightness or color value, this approach reorganizes digital images to create visually striking, abstract effects.

The technique involves using the Processing framework to manipulate images at the pixel level. It abstracts parts of an image while maintaining recognizable elements, producing artistic distortions. Asendorf’s open-source code is highly flexible, allowing me to adjust sorting logic, thresholds, and methods to control the final result.

This coding technique is especially useful for digital artwork, enabling me to create complex compositions from simple inputs.
